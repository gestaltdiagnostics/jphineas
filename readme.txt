jPhineas - a PHIN Messaging System (PHINMS) compatible application.

The goal of this fork of jPhineas is to create a Mirth Connect compatible
version of jPhineas.  This may ultimately become a Mirth extention, but
will start by leveraging the JavaScript destination.

=========================================================================

The Public Health Information Network Messaging System (PHINMS) is the 
CDC-provided software that fulfills this critical need for public health. 
Employing Electronic Business using Extensible Markup Language (ebXML) 
technology, PHINMS can securely send and receive any message type over the 
Internet, facilitating interoperability among myriad public health 
information systems.
