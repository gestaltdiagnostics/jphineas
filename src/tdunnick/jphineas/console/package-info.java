/**
 * jPhineas features a web based console to perform the following functions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Monitor and Manage Queues</li>
 * <li>Graphically Monitor Statistics - a Dashboard</li>
 * <li>Ping Configured Routes</li>
 * <li>Examine Recent Logged Events</li>
 * <li>Manage Configuration</li>
 * <li>Restart Services</li>
 * <li>Provide General Information</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The console servlet "controller" is mapped to a HTML page in web.xml for 
 * each of the above functions. A "model" is called, based on the URL, and 
 * is expected to return a data structure. This data is then embedded in the 
 * request object and passed to a corresponding JSP "view" to complete the 
 * MVC paradigm.
