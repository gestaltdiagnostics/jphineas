/**
 * jPhineas queues are the mechanism that provides control, status, audit,
 * and persistence of state.  A single configuration file describes queue
 * types including a list of fields, and connections for persistence.  For
 * queue types, the naming used by the persistence is abstracted from the
 * application by an ID.  That allows dB's for example, to use field naming that
 * differs from jPhineas conventions if desired.
 * <p>
 * Likewise, connections are abstracted from the actual persistence and managed
 * here.  Initial support is provided for JDBC and a simple file based "Memory"
 * connection, but other types can be added as desired (for example a remote JMX
 * service).
 * <p>
 * A manager is created for each configuration.  It creates the needed connections
 * and types and uses them to dole out queues as requested.  The connections hold
 * the implementation details for a given persistence, which queue users access
 * via the queue or a queue row.
